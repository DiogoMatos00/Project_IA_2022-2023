- Two ways to classify SPAM and HAM with **Perceptron**.

- Lastly an **AC-3 Algorithm** to resolve a Sudoku.

** With **Naive Bayes** and **Perceptron** we obtained all e-mails through a public database. Before using it I recommend running an Antivirus because this database is public and could countian unwanted spyware.
